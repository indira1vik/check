# 3T17 Game App

Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game, Arizona State University, Group 17.
This project implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with some key elements where the user can play against AI with 3 levels of difficulty where the AI can take perfect moves at the hardest and at the easiest it will make deliberate blunders. The games are recording into a Room database and are displayed to the user, where it shows the difficulty, winner, and time of the game. These are the foundational elements in our Tic-Tac-Toe game, we use alpha-beta pruning and a Mini-Max algorithm to allow the AI agent to determine optimal moves within the game.
